# Work Efficiently

Azul.js exposes a simple API that follows patterns found in popular tools
available in other languages like [Django][django] and [Ruby on Rails][rails].
You'll feel right at home when working with Azul.js. Even if you haven't worked
with other ORMs, our [documentation][azul-getting-started] is top notch, so
you'll be building stellar apps in no time.

```js
var Article = db.model('article', {
  title: db.attr(),
  author: db.belongsTo('user')
});

var User = db.model('user', {
  name: db.attr(),
  username: db.attr(),
  articles: db.hasMany('article', { inverse: 'author' })
});

Article.objects.with('author').fetch().then(/* ... */);

// -> select * from "articles";
// -> select * from "users" where "id" in (?, ?, ?) limit 3;
// !> [3,5,8]
```

# Express Yourself

Azul.js was designed to be the most expressive ORM for Node.js. You'll write
good code that others can easily understand. Want to find all articles that
include a comment that is spam? Simple.

```js
Article.objects.where({ 'comments.spam': true }).fetch().then(/* ... */);

// -> select "articles".* from "articles"
// -> inner join "comments" on "comments"."article_id" = "articles"."id"
// -> where "comments"."spam" = ?
// -> group by "articles"."id"
// !> [true]
```

# Join Us

From the beginning, Azul.js was created with ease of use and quality in mind.
Focus has been placed on expressiveness of the API,
[documentation][azul-api-docs], security, [code quality][azul-codeclimate], and
[test coverage][azul-coveralls].

We'd love your help in making it even better. :)
